      The website you're visiting, at
      <a href='http://ricardolopes.net'>ricardolopes.net</a>, and its
      <a href='http://ricardolopes.net/blog'>blog</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a bad experience with Wordpress, I've decided to redo my website and
      blog from scratch using Jekyll. This gives me more control over the
      project, and no longer depends on a database.

    "<p>
      As part of my <a href='http://ricardolopes.net/#masters-degree'>Master's thesis</a>,
      I've created an
      <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/rplopes/lss-usdl'>RDF ontology</a>
      called LSS-USDL, to map service systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This editor was created as part of that work, so that mapping those
      systems could be done not only by editing RDF code, but also using a
      graphical tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ontology and editor and the rest of the research done for my thesis
      later resulted in the publication of a
      <a href='http://ricardolopes.net#service-systems-book'>book</a>.
