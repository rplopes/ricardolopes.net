              We have a problem with passwords: they suck. They’re hard to
              memorise, easy to steal and sometimes have to fit to very specific
              and silly rules. Online security, nowadays, is just too
              complicated. So most people tend to end up ignoring security
              practises, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. You know you
              should be doing better, but you don’t know exactly how or why, and
              your patience and energy are better focused somewhere else, right?
              If so, then this guide is for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s start debunking some myths and exploring easy and secure
              practises you can start implementing today. By the end of this
              guide, dealing with your passwords should actually be simpler and
              need less of your energy than before.
            </p>
            <h2 id="use-long-not-cryptic-passwords">
              Use long, not cryptic passwords
            </h2>
            <p>
              You’ve probably heard that the strongest passwords are the ones
              that have letters (lowercase and uppercase), numbers, special
              symbols like # or ! and that aren’t common words. So something
              like <code>b@2Y&amp;s</code> would be great. But that’s too hard
              to remember, so you go for something simpler, or decide to note
              that down somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have some good news for you: that example password I just showed
              you is actually terrible, and you shouldn’t torture yourself
              trying to memorise something like that. Why is it terrible?
            </p>
            <p>
              A typical attack tries to guess your password by trying every
              single possible combination of characters until it finds the right
              one. So it could start trying for <code>a</code>, then
              <code>b</code>, then <code>c</code>, at some point going through
              <code>Y</code>, <code>Z</code>, <code>aa</code>, <code>ab</code>,
              and so on. For 1-character long passwords with letters and
              numbers, that means that such an attack tries 62 different
              possibilities (26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters and 10
              numbers, from 0 to 9). For 2-characters long passwords, the number
              of different possibilities rises to 3,906. And so on. For a
              6-characters long password that’s around 57 billion different
              combinations.
            </p>
            <p>
              But <code>b@2Y&amp;s</code> includes special symbols like @ and +.
              Let’s say that means that there are now 38 more symbols to
              consider, making it a total of 100 (26 lowercase letters, 26
              uppercase letters, 10 numbers and 38 special symbols). Now, the
              number of different possibilities to consider to break your
              6-characters long password increases to 1 trillion. That’s why
              adding those symbols is good: it’s more combinations that
              attackers have to try.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if, instead of adding those symbols, we just increase the
              password size from 6 to 8 characters, the number of different
              combinations rises to 222 trillion. So a password like
              <code>2Bananas</code> is 222 times harder to break than a password
              like <code>b@2Y&amp;s</code>! If you add numbers and special
              symbols it gets even better, of course. But that doesn’t mean
              having to come up with impossible to remember passwords. Something
              like <code>2Bananas!!</code> would need 101,010,101 trillion
              combinations (also because it increases in size).
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is this important? Those numbers of different combinations
              might all seem too big to be a problem. However, computers are
              getting increasingly fast. If a computer can try a billion
              combinations per second, for instance, then breaking
              <code>b@2Y&amp;s</code> takes less than 17 minutes. Breaking
              <code>2Bananas</code> would take around 2.5 hours. Breaking
              <code>2Bananas!!</code> would take 3,200 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              So if there’s one thing you should be remembering from this post
              is this: longer passwords are <em>way</em> better than shorter
              passwords, even if you don’t use special characters. They’re also
              way easier to remember. So go ahead and change them now. The
              biggest example I showed was still small (just 10-characters
              long), so that the numbers wouldn’t be too high to understand. But
              in practise it’s better to use even longer passwords.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">Here’s a great comic</a> on this
              topic.
            </p>
            <h2 id="dont-use-common-passwords">Don’t use common passwords</h2>
            <p>
              Just because you were just freed from using cryptic passwords like
              <code>Rs*F2Q9kn%[L</code>, it doesn’t mean that you can use
              <em>any</em> word for a password. You’ve just learned how to
              protect against a brute-force attack, but there are other kinds of
              attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attackers know that brute-force attacks can be extremely
              inefficient against long passwords. Wait 3,200 years to break a
              password? Good luck with that. So they like shortcuts. If a lot of
              people use <code>password</code>, <code>qwerty</code>,
              <code>1234567890</code> or others, then there’s no need to wait
              for all possible combinations: they can just try those ones first.
              Here’s a list of the 10 most common passwords, as of 2014:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><code>123456</code></li>
              <li><code>password</code></li>
              <li><code>12345</code></li>
              <li><code>12345678</code></li>
              <li><code>qwerty</code></li>
              <li><code>1234567890</code></li>
              <li><code>1234</code></li>
              <li><code>baseball</code></li>
              <li><code>dragon</code></li>
              <li><code>football</code></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              A lot of accounts are currently using one of those passwords. This
              means that if an attacker doesn’t want to wait to get access to
              logged in accounts, they just need to try these. So if you use any
              of these passwords for any of your online accounts, change it
              <em>right now</em>, because it takes any serious attacker a
              fraction of a second to break it, even if you’re not specifically
              the only target! In fact, take a look at the
              <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12456779.htm"
                >original, longer list</a
              >
              and make sure it’s not in there also.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using your email address, full name, name of the website you’re
              visiting or anything like that isn’t also going to be a lot safer.
              Those are all things that an attacker will know. So it’s important
              that you choose uncommon or illogical words or phrases, because
              those will be nearly impossible to guess (once again, refer to the
              comic in the previous section).
            </p>
            <p>
              So, one last time, please remember: <em>never</em> use any of
              those most popular passwords as a password to any kind of account
              you might have. Having one of those is almost as safe as having
              nothing at all.
            </p>
            <h2 id="dont-repeat-passwords">Don’t repeat passwords</h2>
            <p>
              You’ve probably heard this one before. You should have different
              passwords for every account. But it’s so hard to remember any
              password, how could anyone possibly remember that many? And why
              should you even do it, exactly?
            </p>
            <p>
              If a website you’re using doesn’t properly protect login details
              and gets hacked, a list with your email and password gets leaked
              for every attacker to use. So if you’re using the same combination
              in different websites, no matter how secure they might be, your
              account there will still be compromised. Sometimes you don’t even
              need to have a website get hacked: you just need someone to get
              physical access to your PC, or to
              <a
                href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/hacked-french-network-exposed-its-own-passwords-during-tv-interview/"
                >glance at your post-it with a complicated password written
                down</a
              >, among other possibilities. Getting passwords is easy. So you
              don’t want people entering your bank account because somebody
              watched you type your Facebook password.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how can anyone remember so many different passwords? I hope
              that if you read the previous sections, this one gets easier.
              We’ve discussed how cryptic, impossible to memorise passwords
              aren’t that good, and how memorable phrases are actually much more
              secure. If that still sounds too difficult to do for every single
              account you have online, then make sure that you do it at least
              for the most important ones (like your bank account, or your email
              account where you keep important confidential notes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Since you should now be using phrases as passwords, you might want
              to make some rules that let you have different passwords for
              different accounts without having too much to memorise. For
              instance, you could include the main colour of the website. So for
              Facebook you could use <code>2BlueBananas</code>, and for GMail
              <code>2RedBananas</code>. This isn’t perfect, and you shouldn’t be
              too obvious (like just adding the website name), but it’s better
              than nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              A better approach to have great passwords that never repeat for
              different websites is to use a password manager. A password
              manager is an application that you can have in your devices that
              will generate strong passwords for your and store them securely.
              This way, passwords can be long and cryptic, because you don’t
              need to remember them, and you can have one of those per account.
              Comparing different password managers and explaining how to use
              them goes out of scope of this guide, but it might be a good topic
              for a future one. If you’re curious, I invite you to investigate
              more and start using one. It will be the best you’ll do for your
              security online.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Use long passwords. For every character that you add, breaking
                your password gets incredibly more difficult. It’s ok if it’s
                20, 30 characters long.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t use cryptic passwords. There’s no point in trying to
                memorise <code>b@2Y&amp;s</code> (or noting it down somewhere
                insecure) if longer, more memorable passwords like
                <code>2Bananas!!</code> are way more secure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t use common passwords. Those are the absolute worst.
                Really. Never use anything from

              </li>
              <li>
                Use different passwords for different accounts. At least for
                important accounts, like your bank.
              </li>
              <li>
                Coming up with some rules (like adding the colour of the
                website) is not perfect, but better than doing nothing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Better yet, you could start using a password manager that will
                pick great passwords for you and store them securely, so that
                you can have one per account and will never need to memorise
                them again.

                I've changed a bit my opinion on some of these recommendations.
                Having a base common password that is extended with some
                knowledge from a particular service is better than just plain
                reusing the same for everything, sure, but it's still unsafe and
                easily exploited, so it's not a great recommendation. Memorable
                words can have higher entropy than cryptic passwords, sure, but
                only as long as they are truly random: if you use natural
                phrases or join words that make sense together, you may be
                preventing bute-force attacks, but you're making yourself
                vulnerable to dictionary attacks (i.e. attackers trying common
                words and phrases instead of every character combination).</i
