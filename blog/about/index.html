              Hi, I'm Ricardo Lopes, a tech lead and backend engineer, and
              welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'm sharing a
              collection of thoughts, experiments, wise advice from my mentors,
              notes on things I'm reading, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first goal with this blog is selfish: I want to write about
              those topics because writing helps clarify my thinking and
              crystallise what I've learned. It also acts as a nice personal
              knowledge base.
            </p>
            <p>
              But if that were my only goal, I wouldn't need to post anything in
              public.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe I wouldn't be where I am today in my career if it
              weren't for the exceptional mentors I got along the way. I've
              learned a lot from them, and I'm a much better developer today
              than what I would have been otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I've benefited from all those lessons, I believe it's my
              turn to pay it forward and to share what I've learned with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm no guru preaching his gospel to his disciples. I don't claim
              to have all the answers, and I still view myself more as a
              student, not as a teacher. So this is more about sharing notes as
              peers of the things that resonated with me the most.
            </p>
            <p>

              follow along. I hope to make it well worth your time!
