              Hi, I'm Ricardo Lopes, a tech lead and backend engineer. Welcome
              to my blog! This is where I'm sharing a collection of thoughts,
              experiments, wise advice from my mentors, notes on things I'm
              reading, and more. All views are my own and not of any employer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first goal with this blog is selfish: I want to write about
              those topics because writing helps clarify my thinking and
              crystallise what I've learnt. I've been learning so much since I
              started this journey over a decade ago, if I don't write things
              down, I risk forgetting important anecdotes and nuggets of wisdom.
            </p>
            <p>
              But if that were my only goal, I wouldn't need to post anything in
              public.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe I wouldn't be where I am today in my career if it
              weren't for the exceptional mentors I had along the way. I've
              learnt a lot from them, and I'm a much better developer today than
              what I would have been otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I've benefited from all those lessons, I believe it's my
              turn to pay it forward and to share what I've learnt with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm no guru preaching his gospel to his disciples. I don't claim
              to have all the answers, and I still view myself more as a
              student, not as a teacher. So this is more about sharing notes as
              peers of the things that resonated with me the most.
            </p>
