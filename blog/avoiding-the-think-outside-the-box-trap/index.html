              These days I’m getting sick and tired of all the “think outside
              the box” talk. In my area (technology and computers stuff) we have
              three kinds of young people: those who have yet to wake up for
              reality (mostly gamers that chose this area because it’s about
              those machines that can run videogames); those who want to play
              safe and spend their years being treated as slaves in a low-wage
              and unfulfilling job; and those that love to “think outside the
              box”. So what is that thoughtful activity anyway?
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thinking outside the box” means trying unconventional ideas and
              questioning the status quo to get to new conclusions and
              possibilities. Imagine all you take for granted in this world and
              all your beliefs being put in a box. That means that whenever
              you’re solving a problem or looking for an answer, you’re thinking
              inside that box of yours. You’re in your comfort zone. You’re
              safe. But there is a full world of possibilities outside of that
              box to be explored, and sometimes the answer to a problem might
              just be hidden outside of those boundaries. So you have to step
              out of your comfort zone and explore new ideas and beliefs you you
              want to get your answers.
            </p>
            <p>That is the theory. Now for reality.</p>
            <p>
              At least among rather young people (18 to 30?) in the technology
              area, that expression is very popular. People use it to try to
              stand out from the crowd, although much of the crowd is using it
              already by now. Even though they might not notice it, they’re not
              really using it in its original meaning anymore: for the tech
              guys, “thinking outside the box” is avoiding the low-wage
              unfulfilling job and challenging the standard, usually by trying
              to live an entrepreneur’s adventure or simply by chatting about
              the latest innovations and what cool technological projects could
              be made out of them. In every meetup, in every talk, in every
              event, there it is: the dreaded “think outside the box” telling
              you to create the next Google or Facebook and live the startup
              entrepreneur’s dream (this is actually an oversimplification, but
              I hope you can still see my point here).
            </p>
            <p>
              So, have you noticed something terribly wrong so far? If not,
              please read the description of the original meaning of that
              expression again. It seems that almost all the tech guys are
              pointing to the same direction when they talk about “thinking
              outside the box”. Not just to the same direction, but many times
              also to the very same spot! Now how’s that for challenging your
              beliefs, getting out of the comfort zone and exploring new ideas
              and possibilities? How come can you talk about shifting the way
              you question the world and then fall to the same exact spot as
              everybody else who tries to do the same?
            </p>
            <p>
              Eager to stand out from the crowd and expand their ideas, people
              move their thoughts out of their box, just to let them fall in
              another one. This “second box”, as it might be called, is just a
              trap state where you can easily fall if you don’t see it. But hey,
              nobody said it’d be easy to truly get out of that hated box! The
              whole purpose was to do the near-impossible and change the status
              quo, so it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise if there are some
              traps and pitfalls on the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how can that trap be avoided so that we can truly achieve great
              paradigm shifts and new discoveries? Unfortunately, there is no
              right answer for it, at least that I’m aware of. If I new it, I’m
              sure I’d be a much better and happier person by now. However, I’m
              sure it wouldn’t hurt to stop thinking so much about creating new
              startups and launching new technological products, and start
              trying to push creativity and imagination to come up with amazing
              new ideas. Not million-dollar business ideas (although those might
              also be welcome), but simply crazy ideas that at the end of the
              day will have an impact on you and on the world around you.
            </p>
            <p>
              How many tech folks would consider travelling to a country not
              knowing a single word of their language just to help children with
              family problems? How many with the right skills would work with a
              young NGO to develop their website without asking anything in
              return? And how many would spend hours every week watching
              recorded lectures online from the world’s best universities and
              doing their exercises?
            </p>
            <p>
              As every other guy will tell you, it’s still nice to look for
              entrepreneurship adventures, though (as I’ve also done and intend
              to keep doing). Just keep in mind that it’s just one pattern you
              can follow when you’re trying to think different and broaden your
              scope of the world, and that there is an endless list of other
              patterns, some of them better, others worse. Just don’t fall in
              the trap of immediately going for that “second box” if that wasn’t
              your initial goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you dodge that trap, there is a whole world of new adventures
              waiting for you. A scary world, way different from your usual
              assumptions and mostly unknown And still, powerful enough to amaze
              you and to give you new insights and tools for critical thinking,
              problem solving and self-fulfilment.
            </p>
