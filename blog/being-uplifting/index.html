              When someone chooses a career, they go for the work they like the
              most, within their abilities. I know I did when I followed
              software development. And yet, you don't see many people
              celebrating Mondays and lamenting the end of the week. Not even
              close.
            </p>
            <p>
              Somewhere along the way we all experience the office politics, the
              bad management, the boring tasks, the lack of agency, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>We love the craft, but not necessarily the job.</p>
            <p>
              In all the teams I've worked with, I've never seen an ideal
              scenario where nothing is wrong. And I don't think I will, ever.
              And neither will you. The real world is always messy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's up to us to decide how we want to react to everything that is
              wrong around us.

            <p>
              Early in my career, I wouldn't shy away from the opportunity to
              complain about everything that was wrong with the codebase and
              with the company. Something was wrong, so someone had to complain
              about it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Asked to waste time fixing data inconsistencies rather than
              addressing their root cause? What a prioritisation failure from
              leadership! Long build times slowing down development? What a
              terrible mess we've inherited from those who coded that in the
              first place!
            </p>
            <p>
              It truly felt like an important service to raise awareness of
              issues that were holding the company's mission back.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, I got more experience and respect from peers. I was
              still an individual contributor, but was naturally doing more and
              more mentoring work.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, I was mentoring two recently-joined junior developers who
              were still learning how things worked. I was trying to be helpful
              and authentic, so I made sure to highlight plenty of issues with
              the codebase and with the organisation. It's useful to know the
              pitfalls to look out for, after all. All in good spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, I had a conversation with my team lead, who learned about
              that session. That's where I had one of the biggest realisations
              of my career.
            </p>
            <h2 id="heading-being-intentional">Being intentional</h2>
            <p>
              See, my intentions surely were pure, but I wasn't being the
              helpful mentor I thought I was: I was just being a complainer. I
              was just ranting about all the things I disliked.
            </p>
            <p>
              As newly joined junior developers, they looked up to more
              established senior developers to form their opinion about what
              they've just signed up for. And if established senior developers
              paint such a gloomy picture, that's what they assume as true.
            </p>
            <p>
              This sounds obvious in hindsight, but sometimes we need the timely
              reminder: if you've got a balanced view about something, but you
              overly focus on the bad parts, then you're not sharing an accurate
              representation of your views. Others can't read your mind, only
              interpret your actions, so they'll believe your views are the
              non-representative picture you've shared.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realised that we shouldn't be complainers: instead, we should be
              intentional, fair reporters of our full range of opinions. This is
              especially important if there are people looking up to us and
              valuing and trusting what we're saying!
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation was critical to set the stage for the next one.
            </p>
            <h2 id="heading-being-uplifting">Being uplifting</h2>
            <p>
              Not long after that episode, something else clicked for me. My
              mood can easily be influenced by the environment around me. If
              it's full of complainers, I'll be one, too. If morale is low, mine
              will be as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              After having contributed for so long to an environment of
              complaining, I realised that actually, culture isn't set in stone.
              It's malleable. The culture is set every day by the people who
              show up. And you're one of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter how you rank within your company, you are an influencer
              of its environment. We all are, whether we realise it or not. You
              can choose to blend in with how others set it, or you can opt to
              plant a different seed.
            </p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Influence the environment you want to be a part of. If you're a
              complainer, you're enabling an environment of complainers. If you
              want to be a part of an uplifting environment, it starts with you.
            </p>
            <p>Be an uplifter.</p>
            <p>
              When others complain, you can publicly celebrate your teammatesâ€™
              successes. When others plot against each other, you can ignore the
              noise and focus on beating the only one who matters: your past
              self.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the tasks are dull, use your spare time to explore and learn
              new things, rather than using it to rant about how boring things
              are. If your company offers a learning budget, make good use of
              it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Be intentional with the way you interact with others. Make them
              feel valued and filled with energy, even on days when you don't
              feel that energetic yourself. People remember how you made them
              feel. And they act accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't about dropping your authenticity and pretending to be
              someone you're not, or sharing opinions that aren't what you truly
              think. It's about realising that your actions have consequences,
              and you can be intentional in surfacing your best self.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is also not about toxic positivity. It's still important to
              flag issues and to try to fix them. We shouldn't self-censor any
              criticism, we should just be more strategical about when it's
              actually useful to share it, and being constructive about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is about lifting others up: showing excitement about things,
              not ranting all the time for the sake of it, openly celebrating
              success, being kind to team members, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              And, when in doubt, you can slightly exaggerate these positive
              behaviours. Communication is hard, especially if you're remote,
              for instance, or when writing. So, slight exaggerations go a long
              way in removing ambiguity or misunderstandings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is this mindset change a silver bullet against everything that is
              wrong with a job? Of course not! And if you're in an awful
              environment, your best option may be to look for something better.
            </p>
            <p>
              But for your everyday job, I've seen this mindset shift improve
              not just my day to day, but also the morale of the rest of the
              team. And I'm just a recovering complainer, still with much to
              improve here myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start contributing to the culture you want to be a part of. Be
              intentionally uplifting: share your full range of opinions, but
              focus on abundant positivity towards your teammates and saving
              rants for when they're actually useful.
            </p>
            <p>It starts with you.</p>
