                >previous post</a
              >
              I shared some important tips and resources for anyone who plans on
              developing for the Semantic Web in Ruby (like in a Ruby on Rails
              webapp). If you haven’t checked it yet, I strongly recommend you
              to do so. This new post goes a step further and shows you how to
              convert data from the Semantic Web to your app’s data model and
              also the other way around.
            </p>
            <p>
              To get our mappings between the Semantic Web data and our app’s
              data model we need some Ruby gems. The gem
              <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rdf">rdf</a> lets us parse and
              work with RDF data in Ruby. The gem
              <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/linkeddata">linkeddata</a>
              gives us additional resources for working with the semantic web
              and the Linked Data. Finally, I will also use the gem
              <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rdf-turtle">rdf-turtle</a>
              because I find the Turtle notation to be clearer than the RDF/XML
              notation, so this gem helps us parse this alternative notation (if
              you won’t use Turtle, you’ll be just fine without this gem).
            </p>
            <h2 id="importing-rdf-data-to-ruby">Importing RDF data to Ruby</h2>
            <p>
              As we’ve seen in the previous tutorial, creating a semantic graph
              in Ruby for describing RDF data is as easy as doing:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">RDF</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Graph</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span></code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Now we want to create a semantic graph based on the data of an
              existing RDF file. To do that, we need to change it to:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">RDF</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Graph</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path_of_rdf_file</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              We can now query that graph to import its data to our Ruby
              application. The rdf gem is powerful enough to allow querying that
              graph using pure Ruby code (no SPARQL needed).
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s imagine we’re developing a blog and we’re importing RDF data
              about posts and their authors. We have the models
              <code>Post</code> and <code>Author</code> in our application. The
              RDF ontology that the data on that file is using is called
              <code>MyBlog</code> and has the class <code>Post</code> (for the
              authors, it reuses the class <code>Person</code> from the
              well-known ontology
              <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org">FOAF</a>). That ontology has
              also the properties <code>hasTitle</code> (that links a
              <code>MyBlog:Post</code> to a string of its title) and
              <code>hasAuthor</code> (that links a <code>MyBlog:Post</code> to a
              <code>FOAF:Person</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is an example of how we could query the graph to find all
              posts:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">RDF</span>

<span class="c1"># To get all the posts, we need a SPARQL-like query, but using hashes</span>
<span class="n">query_posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">RDF</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="ss">:post</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="no">RDF</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">MyBlog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Post</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="no">MyBlog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hasTitle</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:title</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="no">MyBlog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hasAuthor</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:author</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">})</span>

<span class="c1"># Build an array of results of that query</span>
<span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">query_posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">graph</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Now we have an array called <code>results</code> that holds all
              instances of objects with <code>RDF:type</code>
              <code>MyBlog:Post</code>. To import the relevant data, we should
              now iterate through these results and create a new
              <code>Post</code> for each. Here is an example of how to do that
              and fetch each post’s title:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">results</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">result_post</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">result_post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span>
  <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              We can fetch the title of the post using
              <code>result_post.title</code> because in the query that
              originated those results we asked to store the value of the
              property <code>MyBlog:hasTitle</code> in a variable called
              <code>title</code>. Remember that the value of
              <code>MyBlog:hasTitle</code> is a string with the title of the
              post, so we can save its value directly in our Ruby class.
            </p>
            <p>
              To fetch each post’s author we need to do an extra step. Unlike
              <code>MyBlog:hasTitle</code>, the
              <code>MyBlog:hasAuthor</code> property doesn’t hold a string: it
              holds a reference to an individual of the class
              <code>FOAF:Person</code>. For our application we want to store the
              author’s name and URI. To get the string with the name of a
              <code>FOAF:Person</code> we need to query its property
              <code>FOAF:name</code>. To get the string with their URI we use
              the reference of the individual. Here is an example of how we
              could modify the last piece of code to add the author’s name and
              URI to the post:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">results</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">result_post</span><span class="o">|</span>

            <p>
              As we can see, this second query looks like it’s cluttering the
              code. This could be avoided if the original query
              (<code>query_posts</code>) was already expecting it. So one way to
              greatly simplify this code would be to change
              <code>query_posts</code> to the following:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">query_posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">RDF</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Query</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">({</span>

    <span class="no">MyBlog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hasTitle</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:title</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="no">MyBlog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hasAuthor</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:author</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="ss">:author</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="ss">FOAF</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">})</span></code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This would fetch not only the full list of posts, but also the
              author (and their name) of that post, because its identifier is
              the same as the identifier of the value of
              <code>MyBlog:hasAuthor</code> (<code>:author</code>). However, if
              an author didn’t have a <code>FOAF:name</code>, we wouldn’t get
              any information of that post, because that query expects results
              in all the variables we’re querying. In addition, if we wanted to
              fetch more information about the post (its creation date, its
              category, etc.), we should only include it in the initial query if
              it’s always present, because otherwise, since there’s a variable
              in the query with no value, the posts that don’t have that value
              won’t be fetched. So the solution to fetch that additional
              information only if it’s available is to do a second query (so
              even if that second query fails for posts without that value, the
              first query still succeeds and at least we got the essential
              information of the post).
            </p>
            <p>
              So unfortunately there might be situations where we do need to do
              further queries that make the overall code look uglier. However,
              there are always ways of trying to mitigate that problem as much
              as possible. One way is to create a separate method for these
              second queries, so to get the author’s name you only had to do:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span></span><span class="n">results</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">result_post</span><span class="o">|</span>

              That method expects to return a string. It might need some
              adjustments for other tasks, like returning the URI of the
              element.

              With this information, it is now possible to fetch all the
              information we need from an RDF file to the Ruby application’s
              data model. Now we look at the exact opposite: exporting our
              application’s data into an RDF file.

              Exporting relational data from Ruby to semantic data in RDF
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the previous tutorial, in section “Putting the Semantic Web in
              Ruby on Rails”, we already saw how to create a semantic graph in
              Ruby, populate it with RDF classes and properties, and export it
              to a file. Now, we’re using the application’s data model to
              automatically export the application data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lets use the same blog example for the export process. The first
              thing we need to do is get everything ready:

              <code>MyBlog</code> represents the ontology we’ve been using.
              <code>data</code> represents the namespace of this blog
              application (one of the many that would be using the
              <code>MyBlog</code> ontology). We can now iterate through all the
              blog’s posts and save them to the semantic graph:

            <p>
              In the code snippet above we first fetch a unique URI for the blog
              post, because every object in RDF must have an identifying URI. We
              could implement a method to generate such URI based on some rules
              (an auto-incremented integer, truncating its title, etc.), or we
              could avoid that step if we saved its URI when we were importing
              the RDF data. However, if your application is intended to make it
              easier for users to manage semantic data, chances are not all the
              exported objects were previously imported.
            </p>
            <p>
              After generating the identifying URI, we use it to add the post to
              the semantic graph. <code>data[uri]</code> joins the application’s
              namespace (defined in the snippet of code before this last one)
              with the generated URI (so if a post got an URI
              <code>my-first-post</code>, it would result in
              <code>http://example.com/myblogdata#my-first-post</code>).
              <code>RDF.type</code> and <code>MyOnt.Post</code> return the
              property <code>type</code> of the ontology <code>RDF</code> and
              the class <code>Post</code> of the ontology <code>MyBlog</code>,
              respectively. These three elements together are the equivalent of
              the following triple:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb"><span></span><span class="x">&lt;http://example.com/myblogdata#my-first-post&gt;</span>

            </figure>
            <p>
              This means that we are adding to the semantic graph a triple that
              states that the blog post identified by
              <code>my-first-post</code> is of type <code>MyBlog:Post</code>. We
              could extend the previous code to include the remaining
              information of the post:

            <p>
              Finally, we also want to add the author information. Since the
              author is another RDF object, we need to create it and link it to
              the post:

              Now we should have all the information we want in our semantic
              graph. The last step is to export it into an external file. This
              is something that we also dealt with in the previous tutorial, so
              now let’s try to do it using the Turtle notation, to generate
              files that are easier to read by humans:

              The <code>PREFIXES</code> array is optional, but it’s a nice to
              have addition to make the resulting file easier to read. If you
              are using other ontologies, it’s better to add them to that array,
              as well. Then, we use an <code>RDF::Writer</code> to write all
              statements of our semantic graph into a file using Turtle
              (<code>:ttl</code>) notation. This is where the gem rdf-turtle
              comes in handy, so if you’re exporting to a different RDF
              notation, you probably won’t need it.

              As with my previous tutorial, this one is also not intended to be
              a step-by-step manual that gives you a working demo by the end of
              it. Instead, this tutorial is meant to be a helper for everybody
              that is struggling with the integration of the Semantic Web and
              Ruby, and a complement to the previous tutorial. More
              specifically, it is intended to demonstrate how to import and
              export semantic data into/from a Ruby application that relies on a
              relational data model.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I’ve concluded in early 2012, Ruby tools for development with
              the Semantic Web are still not as good as tools that we can find
              for other languages, such as Java. Still, it’s good to see that it
              is in fact possible to import and export data seamlessly using
              pure Ruby, so if this is the main Semantic Web related feature
              your application is supposed to have, the good news is that it
              shouldn’t be too hard to develop it in Ruby on Rails, Sinatra or
              any other Ruby framework.
