              This is one of the most common programming errors I see, and it's
              probably one of the least obvious. Sure, we want to protect our
              code from failure scenarios, but we need to be careful about it:
              there's such a thing as being too defensive in our coding!
            </p>
            <p>To start, here's an example of good defensive coding:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getUserNameById</span>(<span class="hljs-params">userId, users</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> user = users.find(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">user</span> =&gt;</span> user.id === userId);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (user) { <span class="hljs-comment">// user can be undefined if there are no results</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// last name may be null</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [user.firstName, user.lastName].filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">name</span> =&gt;</span> name).join(<span class="hljs-string">' '</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
              In this example, our code is protected against the failure
              scenarios of not finding a user, and dealing with a user who
              doesn't have a last name. It avoids bugs caused by a simpler
              approach such as:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getUserNameById</span>(<span class="hljs-params">userId, users</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> user = users.find(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">user</span> =&gt;</span> user.id === userId);

  <span class="hljs-comment">// fails if user wasn't found</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// returns "firstName null" if last name is null</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">`<span class="hljs-subst">${user.firstName}</span> <span class="hljs-subst">${user.lastName}</span>`</span>;
}
</code></pre>
            <p>We write defensive code to avoid bugs like these.</p>
            <p>
              However, we can overdo it. Defensive code stops being useful when
              it no longer protects us from real failure scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of defensive coding going too far:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getUserNameById</span>(<span class="hljs-params">userId, users</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> filteredUsers = users.filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">user</span> =&gt;</span> user.id === userId);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (filteredUsers) { <span class="hljs-comment">// this is always true</span>
      <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> user = filteredUsers[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];

      <span class="hljs-comment">// after checking that user is set, the ?. is redundant</span>
      <span class="hljs-comment">// there's no need to confirm the user id, that has already been done above</span>
      <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (user &amp;&amp; user?.id === userId) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// ?. is redundant, user is always defined here</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [user?.firstName, user?.lastName].filter(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">name</span> =&gt;</span> name).join(<span class="hljs-string">' '</span>);
      }
    }
  } <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> (error) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// the code above doesn't throw any error to handle here</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, the code is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Protecting against <code>.filter()</code> returning a nullish
                  value, even though it always returns an array (which might be
                  empty). This is unnecessary and confusing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Using optional chaining (<code>?.</code>) to access
                  <code>user</code> properties without throwing an error if
                  <code>user</code> is not defined, even though it already
                  checked that <code>user</code> is always is. This is
                  redundant.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Checking if the selected user has the intended id, even though
                  that's always true because it was filtered by that id. This is
                  pointless.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Handling errors, even though no error is thrown. This is
                  overkill.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The problem with this kind of defensive coding isn't just that it
              makes the code more complicated. There's something even worse
              happening.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we write code, we write it for other humans, not for
              machines. Machines are happy with binary code, it's us imperfect
              humans who prefer to go for higher levels of abstraction. The code
              we write serves firstly to tell a story to the developers who will
              maintain it, and only then to be compiled or interpreted for a
              machine to run.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story we tell with defensive coding is that there's danger,
              and we're guarding against it. When we write
              <code>if (user)</code>, we're signalling to other developers to be
              cautious: <code>user</code> might not be defined, and assuming it
              is could lead to problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that when we write <code>if (filteredUsers)</code>,
              still drawing from the examples above, we're also telling a story
              about the danger we're guarding against. But this time, there's no
              actual danger: <code>filteredUsers</code> is always defined. The
              story we're telling is a lie.
            </p>
            <p>
              At best, this lie will be
              <a href="https://ricardolopes.net/blog/no-surprises/"
                >surprising</a
              >
              and confuse developers reading the code, which will throw them off
              and hurt their productivity: "Huh, weird, why are we checking if
              <code>filteredUsers</code> is set? Doesn't
              <code>.filter()</code> always return an array?"
            </p>
            <p>
              At worst, developers will believe this lie and think there's a
              danger when there isn't. They might think
              <code>.filter()</code> returns a nullish value when it doesn't
              find records, even though that's not what it does! Or they might
              think an empty array evaluates to <code>false</code>, while it
              actually evaluates to <code>true</code> (a genuine mistake when
              dealing with JavaScript).
            </p>
            <p>
              When developers start believing incorrect things about the code,
              these beliefs spread. If you're unsure whether a variable is set,
              you end up adding unnecessary checks everywhere. If the code
              throws an exception in a code branch that never runs, other
              developers will see that exception and start handling it whenever
              they call that code. This can also lead to them adding unit tests
              with mocks that throw that exception, testing behaviour that
              doesn't actually exist in production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, reacting to non-existent problems will harm developer
              productivity, increase code complexity, and lengthen CI times due
              to more code branches needing tests. It will also hurt performance
              because of unnecessary checks and missed optimisation
              opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can push back against overly defensive coding by not blindly
              believing the story the code tells. For example, we can always
              verify what a piece of code actually does and remove anything
              redundant. Another strategy is to ensure great test coverage,
              making it easier to refactor with confidence, knowing we're just
              removing unnecessary checks without changing behaviour. There are
              even lint rules that can help, like eslint's

                >no-useless-escape</a
              >
              or typescript-eslint's
              <a
                target="_blank"

                >no-unnecessary-condition</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's important to defend against actual threats, but defending
              against imaginary ones isn't just unimportant: it's actually
              harmful. Be cautious of overly defensive coding, and always be on
              the lookout for lies in the code.
