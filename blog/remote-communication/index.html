              There's been a long debate about remote vs on-site work. Some say
              remote is better because it cuts down on commuting and office
              costs and widens the talent pool. Some say it's worse because you
              miss the spontaneous hallway conversations, and maybe people
              aren't even working that hard if they're left unsupervised at
              home.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe remote work is better for most, though I admit it might
              not be the best option for all. If close human connection is what
              drives you at work, or if you're just starting out and still need
              frequent mentoring and training, an on-site experience may be a
              better fit for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite my thoughts on remote work, I mostly saw it as an
              acceptable balance of trade-offs. You don't get the productivity
              boost of direct in-person collaboration, but at least that's
              offset by the productivity gains of no commute and no office
              distractions. You don't get the serendipity of overhearing someone
              mentioning something relevant to your work, but at least by hiring
              globally instead of locally, you get access to potentially much
              better talent.
            </p>
            <p>
              One trade-off I believed was that face-to-face communication was
              simply better, but at least remote allowed us to communicate
              through geographies. Too bad we had to put up with Zoom fatigue,
              technical issues, bad sound quality, “if you're talking, you're on
              mute”.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I've realised is that yes, calls can be worse than in-person
              conversations, but the remote communication superpower lies
              elsewhere: asynchronous communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              Synchronous communication requires participants to engage
              synchronised at the same time. That can be meetings, calls or live
              chats, for instance. Honestly, I still believe on-site is a better
              experience here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Asynchronous communication doesn't require everyone to be in sync:
              they're free to engage whenever and however works best for them.
              That can be documentation, Pull Requests, recorded videos and so
              on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first obvious reason why async communication is great is that
              it frees people to participate at their own time. If you're busy
              with your task, you can watch later. If you're on the school run,
              you can add your update when you're back. If you're participating
              in different projects with conflicting schedules, you can catch up
              on everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't just about letting people choose their time: even if
              there was no schedule flexibility, this is great because it works
              for people who couldn't show up. You don't miss the important
              communication because you were out sick that day. You can even get
              the latest communications from even before you've joined the team!
              This would be impossible for in-person meetings and hallway
              discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's take standups as an example. Every morning, the team gathers
              to report the status of each task and identify any blocker. I
              found face-to-face standups to be better than calls, that just add
              a layer of networking and technical issues. Calls were the
              necessary evil to be able to do a standup with global top talent
              instead of local talent only.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if we switch from sync to async communication we get
              everyone posting their own update, no call needed. That's great
              because you no longer lose the discussion when the schedule
              doesn't suit you or when you're out that day. Perhaps it's not as
              good at sparking deeper discussions to brainstorm issues or
              identify blockers, but that's the trade-off. Or another advantage,
              if you view those as tangents taking time from the standup's
              purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I've just recently realised is that there's an even bigger
              benefit of async communication: historical context. You're not
              just getting the most recent communication, you're getting all
              communications that ever happened, always available. Of course I
              knew this happened, it just hadn't clicked yet how powerful that
              could be.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting back to the standups example, you not only get to check
              what anyone from any team reported that day, but you can also
              check their updates through time. This is useful to understand the
              progress of specific projects, to get a more objective view of how
              your direct reports are performing, or even for yourself to
              remember the noteworthy work you've been doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used to think face-to-face chats were more natural and pleasant,
              therefore better overall. But with these async communication
              benefits, they just sound objectively worse now. Imagine the
              wasted productivity from all the institutional knowledge lost from
              in-person discussions that never got recorded. No one else got
              access to those discussions, and even the participants weren't
              able to review them later. This isn't a trade-off, this is a
              disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
              This doesn't mean all sync communication is bad. Sometimes it's
              just easier to hop on a quick call to align on something when it's
              not working through writing. As always, there's the right tool for
              each job. It's just that we usually default to one tool, while
              another turns out to be much better for most of those jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              To sum up, prefer async communication like writing over sync
              communication like calling. It's inclusive to those who would have
              missed the call, can be shared with people who don't attend those
              calls, and can be persisted through time for future reference. I'm
              now convinced that this is the most effective team communication
              strategy.
            </p>

              Fun fact: this realisation was one of the triggers that got me to

              different discussions, I can publish them once, and make them
              available to everyone, at any time. What a bargain!
