              Feeling like building your new bog from scratch with tools that
              empower you to develop it the way you want? You’ve come to the
              right place. If you’re just starting, make sure you read
              <a href="/blog/setting-up-a-hackers-blog-with-jekyll/">part 1</a>
              of this tutorial, where you can learn the advantages of using
              Jekyll over other options and how to use it to create a basic blog
              from scratch. In this second part we’ll be working with the same
              blog example code to extend it and make it more interesting.
              However, if you’re just looking for a particular solution to a
              problem you might have with your existing blog, these examples
              should be self-contained enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just to recap from the previous tutorial: we’re using the gem
              <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate our blog’s
              static pages. We do that by running <code>jekyll serve</code>,
              which also allows us to test it in our browser locally. Our blog
              code structure is currently looking like this:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>_config.yml
_layouts
    default.html
    post.html
_posts
    <span class="m">2015</span>-02-01-hello-world.md
_site
index.html</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>Now without further ado let’s get hacking.</p>
            <h2 id="better-urls">Better URLs</h2>
            <p>
              Jekyll defaults URLs to the format
              <code>/:year/:month/:day/:title.html</code>. So our Hello World
              post has the URL <code>/2015/02/01/hello-world.html</code>.
              However, this isn’t the best structure: it’s long and exposes a
              file extension and the full date. We can change this by setting a
              value to <code>permalink</code> in <code>_config.yml</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re ok with showing the full date on the URL (some blogs do
              this to give a temporal context and to make it easier to have
              multiple posts with the same slug), then you can set the value of
              <code>permalink</code> to <code>pretty</code>, which hides the
              HTML extension:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>name: My blog
author: Ricardo Lopes
twitter: ricardoplopes

permalink: pretty</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              I typically prefer to remove the date from the URL, because I want
              my posts to be generally timeless, and because if they got an
              update, that URL would suddenly be misleading. You can do that
              setting <code>permalink</code> to <code>none</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, that still exposes the HMTL file extension, which I also
              don’t want. Jekyll doesn’t provide a direct value for these
              requirements, but fortunately it lets you build your own custom
              URLs. So if you want URLs that simply display the post slug you
              need to change your <code>_config.yml</code> to:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>name: My blog
author: Ricardo Lopes
twitter: ricardoplopes

permalink: "/:title"</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              You can adapt that to your needs: prefer having the categories and
              the publication year included? Change it to
              <code>/:categories/:year/:title</code>. And so on.
            </p>
            <h2 id="paginating-our-list-of-posts">
              Paginating our list of posts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Right now we’re displaying every single blog post in our index
              page, which is far from ideal. Since we have just one blog post so
              far we still don’t see a problem with it, but if we get to
              hundreds, we really shouldn’t be showing them all in one page.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the sake of experimentation, let’s create two new blog posts.
              Our posts directory should now look like this:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>_posts
    <span class="m">2015</span>-02-01-hello-world.md
    <span class="m">2015</span>-03-01-my-second-post.md
    <span class="m">2015</span>-04-01-aprils-fools-post.md</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Now that we have 3 different posts, we can paginate our blog to
              show only 2 posts per page. Ideally you might want more posts per
              page, but for now this should be good enough to test what we want.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pagination is done by setting the number of posts per page in the
              config attribute <code>paginate</code> and, if you want a
              particular URL for those pages, setting its format like the one
              described for permalinks in the config attribute
              <code>paginate_path</code>. So to test for 2 posts per page, our
              <code>_config.yml</code> would change to something like:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>name: My blog
author: Ricardo Lopes
twitter: ricardoplopes

permalink: "/:title"

paginate: 2
paginate_path: "/:num"</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              However, if you visit your blog now you’ll notice that it’s still
              not paginating. That’s because we’ve configured pagination, but
              we’re still not using it. Let’s look back at
              <code>index.html</code>:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

{% for post in site.posts %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ post.url }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              We’re iterating over the full list of the website’s posts. We want
              to iterate over the posts that belong to a particular page of our
              pagination. To do that, we have to fetch <code>posts</code> not
              from <code>site</code>, but from <code>paginator</code>:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

{% for post in paginator.posts %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ post.url }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Great, now we should just see the latest two posts. And if we
              browse <code>/2</code> we should see the second page, with the
              oldest post there. Still, there’s no paginator to browse different
              pages easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can add that to the end of <code>index.html</code>, so that it
              shows after the list of posts. we only want to show it if there’s
              any need for it, i.e. only if there’s a previous page or a next
              page:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>...

{% if paginator.next_page or paginator.previous_page %}
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- paginator code here --&gt;</span>
{% endif %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              With this interface you can do the fanciest paginator you can
              think of. Here’s a suggestion for how
              <code>index.html</code> might look like with one of the simplest
              paginators that can be done:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

{% for post in paginator.posts %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ post.url }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}

{% if paginator.next_page or paginator.previous_page %}
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Previous page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {% else %}
    Previous page
  {% endif %}
  |
  {% if paginator.next_page %}
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ paginator.next_page_path }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Next page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {% else %}
    Next page
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Great, we now have pagination working with proper navigation. Our
              <code>index.html</code> is starting to look crowded, though, and
              if we ever want to reuse the paginator code, there’s a lot there
              to copy and to maintain. It’s time to look at includes.
            </p>
            <h2 id="includes">Includes</h2>
            <p>
              Jekyll has this nice thing called includes, which are basically
              partials that you can reuse on multiple pages. So if you’ve just
              built your perfect paginator and you want to use it in different
              lists of posts, you can just put it in its own include and then
              just call it from those pages. Includes, unlike regular layouts,
              go inside their own directory: <code>_includes</code>. If you want
              to isolate the paginator code into one, then you’ll need to create
              a <code>_includes/paginator.html</code>. Using the same code as
              above, that file would be something like:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>{% if paginator.next_page or paginator.previous_page %}
  {% if paginator.previous_page %}
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Previous page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {% else %}
    Previous page
  {% endif %}
  |
  {% if paginator.next_page %}
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ paginator.next_page_path }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Next page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {% else %}
    Next page
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              As you can see, there’s no need to add a front matter for
              includes. Having this new file, we could then change our
              <code>index.html</code> to be simply:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

{% for post in paginator.posts %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ post.url }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}

{% include paginator.html %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              In the beginning, it might seem that using includes is an overkill
              that just scatters the code all over your code. However, as the
              code gets more complex, some parts start to repeat, or files start
              to get too big. Right now this paginator is only used for one page
              (the blog index), but is ready to be reused by other future pages,
              like tags or categories pages. Another good use for includes is
              using them to isolate external blocks, like share links or
              comments. Speaking of comments…
            </p>
            <h2 id="comments-with-disqus">Comments with Disqus</h2>
            <p>
              Because these blogs are nothing but a group of static pages, it’s
              impossible to serve comments as you would with Wordpress or
              something similar: when a reader wants to post a comment, there’s
              no database for it to go to. So the solution is to use a
              third-party tool to serve comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are plenty of solutions out there that can be used. The most
              popular one, which is also the one I’m using for my blog, must
              probably be <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. It’s usually
              a good option because it allows users to post using their
              favourite social network accounts, lets the same account post on
              multiple blogs, instead of having to create a new one per blog,
              and gives blog authors a good set of tools to moderate and manage
              inbound comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are other platforms for blog comments, like Facebook’s,
              Google’s and more. You should really pick the one that you think
              makes more sense for the type of blog you’re creating. So if
              you’re building an awesome new hacker’s blog, there probably won’t
              be a big audience that prefers to use their personal Facebook
              accounts to engage in the discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because Disqus is usually seen as a good generic option and
              because that’s what I experimented with when I built my blog,
              that’s the one I’m showing how to use. If you want to use another,
              you might still benefit from some of the tips below.
            </p>
            <p>
              To get started with Disqus go to
              <a href="https://disqus.com/">their website</a>, register and
              follow their instructions. You should be given a code snippet to
              paste into your blog. That code snippet should be asking for
              important information like your username, the post’s identifier
              and the post’s URL. This is a great example of code that we can
              put in its own include. So let’s create a
              <code>_includes/disqus.html</code> and drop the code there, using
              the right tags to fill the requested information:

              Now that we have a new include, we just need to add it wherever we
              prefer. Because it’s comments, it makes sense to add it to the
              blog post layout. So <code>_layouts/post.html</code> should be
              updated to:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ page.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ page.date | date_to_string }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
{{ content }}

{% include disqus.html %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              That should be enough to have comments on your blog. Disqus will
              also give you moderator options through their website. Other
              providers should probably give you similar tools. If at some point
              you want to switch commenting providers, you can work on the new
              one’s code on its own include while still keeping the old one, and
              when you’re happy to do the switch you just need to change in the
              post layout the include to be used.

              After having improved our blog in this second tutorial, we should
              now have a structure like this:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>_config.yml
_layouts
    default.html
    post.html
_includes
    disqus.html
    paginator.html
_posts
    <span class="m">2015</span>-02-01-hello-world.md
    <span class="m">2015</span>-03-01-my-second-post.md
    <span class="m">2015</span>-04-01-aprils-fools-post.md
_site
index.html</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              In this second tutorial we covered some more material to get to an
              awesome hacker’s blog. However, there’s still a lot more that we
              can add, and it wouldn’t fit in a single blog post. So there will
              be a third post where I’ll try to cover RSS, categories, tags and
              some theming. If you think that there’s something else worth
              mentioning, do shout.
