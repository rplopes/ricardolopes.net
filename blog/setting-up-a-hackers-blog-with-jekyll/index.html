              If you’re looking for a blogging platform or framework to start
              sharing your thoughts with the rest of the world, there’s no
              shortage of options to consider. My previous blog was a
              self-hosted Wordpress install, a pretty popular option, which
              <a href="/blog/a-postmortem-of-my-wordpress-blog/"
                >turned out to be a disaster for me</a
              >. Other popular options include regular
              <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>,
              <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> or even
              <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. However, if you want
              your blog to exercise your hacking skills, then
              <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jekyll is a static websites and blogs generator that is run from
              the command line. What this means is that instead of setting up a
              database of posts, comments, etc. and a webapp that connects to
              that database to generate dynamic webpages, it simply generates
              all the necessary pages upfront. This means that you don’t have to
              worry about databases, caching, running live server code, and so
              on: it’s as simple and practical as it can get.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone with no programming background,
              however. You’re expected to deal with YAML files to change the
              website settings, HTML with Liquid tags to build the structure of
              every page, Ruby to develop or tweak any plugins and Markdown (or
              an alternative, like Textile or raw HTML) to write any post. Also,
              generating the website after every change (in design, structure,
              or simply after every new post) is done through the command line,
              and after that you still have to upload the generated files to
              your server.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, for the enthusiastic developer, this means that you have
              full control over the entire process. It also means that dealing
              with your blog feels closer than ever to hacking one of your
              projects. You can, in fact, never leave your favourite text
              editor: even for regular blog posts, I get to do everything with
              vim.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enough talk already. If I got your interest, let’s get hacking.
              This is a Ruby tutorial, so I’m assuming that you have Ruby
              installed and are comfortable enough using it.
            </p>
            <h2 id="setting-up-jekyll">Setting up Jekyll</h2>
            <p>
              Jekyll is a Ruby gem, so its installation is what you’d expect:
            </p>
            <pre><code>gem install jekyll
</code></pre>
            <p>
              Now you have two options: you either ask Jekyll to build you a
              complete new site from its default template, or you just go ahead
              and build your own from scratch. For the former, you’d just need
              to type:
            </p>
            <pre><code>jekyll new yourwebsitename
</code></pre>
            <p>
              After that, you’d have your brand new website in the newly created
              <code>yourwebsitename</code> directory. From that directory, you’d
              only need to type <code>jekyll serve</code> to generate the static
              files and be able to browse it.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, that doesn’t feel like hacking at all. So fire up your
              favourite text editor and get yourself a cup of coffee, because
              we’re building it the fun way.
            </p>
            <h2 id="index">Index</h2>
            <p>
              A typical Jekyll blog is structured into specific directories
              inside of the root project directory. So start by creating a
              directory for your new blog, where all the code will live.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the generated static files will go to the directory
              <code>_site</code>. So if you create a new
              <code>index.html</code> in your project root and run
              <code>jekyll serve</code>, a <code>_site/index.html</code> will be
              created. While that Jekyll server is running, you can view that
              generated page at <code>localhost:4000</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For our new blog’s index, we’ll want to iterate through our list
              of blog posts and show their title and excerpt:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
---

{% for post in site.posts %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ post.url }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The templating tags you can see are Liquid tags. You use
              <code>{% text %}</code> for logic like iterating a list (like
              ERB’s <code>&lt;% text %&gt;</code>, and
              <code>{{ text }}</code> for text output (like ERB’s
              <code>&lt;%= text %&gt;</code>). Another relevant remark about the
              code above is that you don’t need to surround the excerpt with
              <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags: its output already includes them.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this code we can see another important part of Jekyll: the
              front matter. It’s the block defined by the triple dashes, and it
              holds any configuration, in YAML, that you might need in a page.
              Right now we’re not needing anything, so we’ll just leave it
              empty. We can’t just remove it, because otherwise the Liquid tags
              won’t get parsed by Jekyll (it would just be treated as a regular,
              static HTML file).
            </p>
            <p>
              Trying to check the generated site with this code won’t show
              anything interesting. That’s because our blog still has no posts
              to display. Let’s fix that.
            </p>
            <h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>
            <p>
              The blog posts must be stored in the
              <code>_posts</code> directory. Their filename should be their
              publication date followed by their intended URL identifier (slug).
              This ensures that you get your posts organised by date and you can
              immediatelly identify any of their files, while it also gives two
              important bits of information to Jekyll to use. So if you want to
              create your Hello World post, you would name it something like
              <code>_posts/2015-02-01-hello-world.md</code> (in this tutorial
              I’m assuming we’re formatting our posts with Markdown). Here’s how
              that file would look like:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
title: Hello World!
---

Welcome to my new **blog**!</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This time we have a use for the front matter: for a blog post we
              need to define a title. It’s not necessary to include the post
              publication date and slug, because Jekyll already gets them from
              the filename.
            </p>
            <p>
              Browsing the generated site should now start to get more
              interesting. You should now be able to see your new post listed in
              the blog index and be able to navigate to its page.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, everything still seems too simple and ugly. It’s time to
              give our blog a proper look.
            </p>
            <h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>
            <p>
              In Jekyll you theme your blog by providing a list of layouts.
              Those are stored in the <code>_layouts</code> directory. Let’s
              start with a default layout <code>_layouts/default.html</code> to
              apply to all our existing pages:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
---

<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span> <span class="na">lang</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>My blog<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span> <span class="na">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"/"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>My blog<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

      {{ content }}

    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              We now have a slightly better design and the blog title in every
              page, linking to the blog index. The contents of every page will
              be replacing that <code>{{ content }}</code
              >. And if you try to browse the generated site… you’ll see that
              nothing changed and the layout isn’t being used.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make every page use this new layout, we have to specify it in
              their front matters. So your index will have to change into:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

{% for post in site.posts %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"{{ post.url }}"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              And, likewise, the front matter of your post will also need to be
              updated:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
title: Hello World!
---

Welcome to my new **blog**!</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              You should now be able to see the changes in the generated site.
              The design is still not great, but styling webpages is out of
              scope of this tutorial. Our blog post, however, still looks
              incomplete, without its title and publication date. We can fix
              that by introducing a new layout, just for blog posts.
              Fortunately, specific layouts can reuse more generic ones, to
              avoid duplicating a lot of code. Here’s how a
              <code>_layouts/post.html</code> could look like:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---
layout: default
---

<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ page.title }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{ page.date | date_to_string }}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
{{ content }}</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Notice that by setting a layout to a layout we avoid a lot of code
              repetition. Now if you change the layout in the post file from
              <code>default</code> into <code>post</code>, you should be able to
              see the post title and publication date in its page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, you might have noticed the new
              <code>| date_to_string</code>. The <code>|</code> is used in
              Liquid to apply the filter specified on the right to the element
              on the left. So in this example we’re applying the
              <code>date_to_string</code> filter to <code>post.date</code>,
              which converts the post publication date into a nicer to read
              string.
            </p>
            <p>
              So now we have a blog index, posts and a theme. Things are
              starting to look better, and you’re now in a position to start
              adding elements like a sidebar, Google Analytics, Disqus comments
              and anything else you want. So now let’s finish with some cleanup,
              to help with future improvements.
            </p>
            <h2 id="configurations">Configurations</h2>
            <p>
              In our defaut layout we’re hardcoding the name of our blog twice.
              If we want to add elements like an RSS feed, semantic annotations
              or others, chances are we’re going to have to hardcode it again.
              The same applies for other information like blog author,
              description and social media links.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, there is a place to store all this information: the
              configurations file, which acts like the ultimate front matter of
              the whole site. So create the <code>_config.yml</code> file in the
              project root:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>name: My blog
author: Ricardo Lopes
twitter: ricardoplopes</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Now we can access any of these variables through the
              <code>site</code> object. We can now change the default layout to
              something more interesting (and maintainable):
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span></span>---

            <p>
              So far we’ve only really scratched the surface on what Jekyll can
              do for our blog. The current structure should be something like:
            </p>
            <figure class="highlight">
              <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span></span>_config.yml
_layouts
    default.html
    post.html
_posts
    <span class="m">2015</span>-02-01-hello-world.md
_site
index.html</code></pre>
            </figure>
            <p>
              However, there’s a lot more hacking that can be done. Some
              examples are building an RSS feed, paginating the index page,
              getting better URLs, better theming and adding categories and
              tags. Also, although you can go ahead and upload the generated
              files to your personal server to get your blog online, it’s still
              worth to discuss some alternatives to ease that process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, it all starts to be too much for a single blog
              post. So expect to see all those examples explained in future
              tutorials.

                been following its progress, so I also don't know how many
                breaking changes it may have gotten, and how broken this
                tutorial may be today.</i
