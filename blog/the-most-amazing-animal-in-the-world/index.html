              There is an animal out there that is far more amazing than
              anything else we might have known before. An animal that has been
              found in the heights of the Himalayas, the warmth of Japanese hot
              springs, the high pressures of the bottom of the ocean, the
              freezing cold of Antarctica, among other places. An animal that
              you’ve probably never seen before, as it’s no longer than 1.5 mm.
              An animal that has been on this planet far longer than we have,
              and that will probably remain after we’re all long gone. That
              animal is the water bear, also known as tardigrade, and this post
              will explain why it is, by far, the most amazing animal in the
              world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tardigrades have been on this planet for the last 500 million
              years. In comparison, humanity started 2 million years ago. Even
              the earliest dinosaurs (227 million years ago) are closer in time
              to us than to the first tardigrades. This means that the
              tardigrades have survived the natural disaster that pushed
              dinosaurs to extinction. In fact, they’ve survived all 5 mass
              extinctions of this planet. But how did they manage to do that?
            </p>
            <h2 id="heat">Heat</h2>
            <p>
              Tardigrades are incredibly resistant to extreme heat. How extreme
              is that, exactly?
            </p>
            <p>
              Most heat-tolerant organisms support up to 122 ºC. These organisms
              are typically simple bacteria, as more complex ones would more
              easily have a weak spot. Tardigrades, however, can do even better:
              in one experiment, they were able to support some impressive

              />
            </p>
            <h2 id="cold">Cold</h2>
            <p>
              The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was some freezing
              -89.2 ºC. So animals don’t really need to worry about anything
              colder than that. Except for the tardigrade, which supports
              temperatures as low as -272 ºC! That’s about just one degree above
              absolute zero, the lowest temperature that can ever exist in the
              universe, when molecules stop moving and even gases turn into
              solids.
            </p>
            <p>
              Near absolute zero, crystals start forming inside animals’ bodies.
              These crystals can tear apart crucial molecules like the DNA.
              However, tardigrades seem to be able to prevent that, thanks to
              their superpower:
            </p>
            <h2 id="tun">Tun</h2>
            <p>
              Tardigrades have a superpower called the tun state. They can get
              into a state where they get rid of all the water in their bodies
              and their metabolism slows down to near 0%. This is like
              hibernation, improved. Because they replaced the water in their
              bodies, they can survive near absolute zero temperatures without
              great risk of crystals forming inside them. They can also survive
              in this state for

                >many years</a

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              After getting into this protective state, tardigrades only need to
              get in contact with water to return to their normal state and get
              back to business.
            </p>
            <h2 id="pressure">Pressure</h2>
            <p>
              Pressure, apparently, is measured with megapascals (MPa). I don’t
              know what 1 MPa means, and probably neither do most of you, so
              let’s put things in perspective:
            </p>
            <p>
              Most systems stop metabolising and start failing at around 30 MPa.
              The deepest part of the sea, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana
              Trench (around 11 km deep), can get pressure up to 100 MPa. So
              that’s the strongest any living organism on Earth would need to
              support. The strongest bacteria, however, can manage up to 300 MPa
              before dying. And tardigrades? Those can support
              <a
                href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v395/n6705/full/395853a0.html"
                >up to 600 MPa</a
              >. That’s twice as much as the strongest bacteria, and 6x more
              than the strongest pressure on this planet!
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <h2 id="radiation">Radiation</h2>
            <p>
              At this point there seems to be little left that could surprise
              us. These tiny animals just seem to be consistently breaking
              records. So how do they fare when handling radiation?
            </p>
            <p>
              Tardigrades are able to sustain
              <a
                href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09553000600972956"
                >1,000x more radiation than other animals</a
              >. A thousand times more. They support up to between 5,000 and
              6,200 Gy (grays, the unit for absorbed radiation), while humans,
              for instance, can’t take more than between 5 and 10 Gy.
            </p>
            <p>
              This incredible resistance to radiation helps explain the next and
              last fact, which might well be the most impressive of them all.
            </p>
            <h2 id="space">Space</h2>
            <p>
              If the previous facts weren’t enough to convince you that we’re
              talking about the most amazing animal in the world, how about this
              one: the tardigrade was the first (and only) known animal to
              survive in space. And by surviving in space, I mean being
              <a
                href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14690-water-bears-are-first-animal-to-survive-space-vacuum.html"
                >left in the vacuum for days, completely exposed to solar
                radiation</a
              >. And then returning home and successfully hatching healthy
              offspring. Humans, in comparison, would die in seconds, either by
              suffocation or due to the radiation.
            </p>
            <h2 id="so-lets-recap">So let’s recap</h2>
            <p>Tardigrades:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>survived 5 mass extinctions (and counting)</li>
              <li>manage up to 151 ºC</li>
              <li>and down to ~1 ºC above absolute zero</li>
              <li>which is 3x colder than the coldest place on Earth</li>
              <li>have an amazing superpower: the tun state</li>
              <li>can live years without food and water</li>
              <li>
                can handle 6x more pressure than the highest pressure on Earth
              </li>
              <li>sustain 1,000x more radiation than other animals</li>
              <li>are the only known animal to survive in space</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And that’s why tardigrades are definitely the most amazing animal
              in the <del>world</del> universe!
