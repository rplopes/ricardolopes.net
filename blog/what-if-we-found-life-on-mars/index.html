              This exciting piece of news makes us all wonder: what if, indeed,
              we found evidence that there is or there was at some point life on
              Mars? And what does that mean for us?
            </p>
            <h2 id="the-fermi-paradox">The Fermi Paradox</h2>
            <p>
              To better understand what that would mean for us, we’ll look at
              the Fermi Paradox. Let’s start with some maths:
            </p>
            <p>
              There are around
              <strong>10<sup>22</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup> stars</strong> in the
              observable universe. That’s 10,000 stars for every grain of sand
              on Earth. Our galaxy alone has between
              <strong>100 to 400 billion stars</strong>. Knowing that around
              <strong>5 to 20%</strong> of those stars are similar to our sun,
              then the lowest estimate points to
              <strong>at least 5 billion</strong> sun-like stars in our galaxy.
              Also, we know that those stars have a probability of
              <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19273.abstract"
                >around <strong>22%</strong></a
              >
              of having en Earth-like planet orbiting it. Adding everything up,
              there’s <strong>at least 1 billion</strong> Earth-like planets
              orbiting sun-like stars in our galaxy alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we need to start getting speculative. How likely is it that a
              planet like that develops life? We know that Earth did, but we
              don’t know if this was a rare occurrence or not. So if we go for a
              conservative route and say there’s just a 1% probability of an
              Earth-like planet orbiting a sun-like star to develop life, then
              that means that there should be
              <strong>at least 10 million</strong> different planets with life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, how many of those planets get life to evolve into an
              intelligent species? Once again, we know that life on Earth
              evolved to that point, but we have no way of knowing how rare we
              are. If we keep speculating with the same probability, then out of
              1% of all those planets that developed life would emerge
              intelligent life. Adding all these conservative estimates up,
              that’s <strong>at least 100 thousand</strong> different
              intelligent species across the galaxy!
            </p>
            <p>
              And that’s not all. The Earth is a young planet orbiting a young
              star. Our galaxy is old, and there are much older planets than
              ours out there. Can we imagine what would it be like for a species
              that evolved at the same rate as ours, but in a planet that’s just
              1 billion years older? How would <strong>we</strong> be in a
              billion years from now? Colonising our galaxy? That’s estimated to
              take around 5 million years, so if we’re talking about a 1 billion
              year period, then that’s something relatively quick to do for such
              a civilisation. Sending communications to other places in the
              universe? Also pretty likely. So if there are younger intelligent
              species, they should be already at that stage. The universe should
              be full of interplanetary communications from many different
              civilisations, and our galaxy should have been colonised by now.
            </p>
            <h2 id="where-is-everybody">Where is everybody?</h2>
            <p>
              So if the universe should be so full of life and communications,
              how come haven’t we seen anything yet? Our observations never
              registered any kind of artificial device that wasn’t launched from
              Earth. And although we keep listening for signals in many
              different wavelengths from space, we still didn’t get a single
              message. This doesn’t make any sense, when we think of our
              previous estimations. So there must be something else going on.
            </p>
            <h3 id="theory-1-theyre-there-we-just-havent-heard-from-them">
              Theory 1: They’re there, we just haven’t heard from them
            </h3>
            <p>
              One theory is that those civilisations exist, but for some reason
              we just never heard from them. And there are many possible
              explanations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe some colonising species did indeed visit Earth at some
              point, but since our civilisation and recorded history are so
              young, they could have visited well before that, and so we would
              have no way to know about it now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or maybe our galaxy is colonised, but we just live in some
              desolate rural area. Similarly, we could still be considered too
              primitive by more developed species, and so we could be living in
              some protected environment (think of something like a zoo).
            </p>
            <p>
              One scary possibility is that there might be a highly developed
              predator species. This would explain not only a lower number of
              existing intelligent civilisations than what we estimated, but
              also why they could be hiding their presence instead of
              broadcasting it. Let’s not think too much about this one, OK?
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe our technology is just too primitive and our understanding
              of space too incomplete. We’re listening for radio signals, but
              maybe they use radio as much as we use smoke signals. Maybe
              there’s a lot of communication going on using different channels,
              like by manipulating sub-atomic particles, and we’re just too
              primitive to be able to listen to that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many other possibilities exist to try to justify this. Maybe
              colonisation doesn’t make sense for higher civilisations after
              all, or maybe we’re just a product of a simulation of some other
              species, or maybe it’s something else no one thought of yet.
            </p>
            <p>However, there’s a scarier theory to explain this paradox.</p>
            <h3 id="theory-2-there-are-no-higher-civilisations-in-existence">
              Theory 2: There are no higher civilisations in existence
            </h3>
            <p>
              Maybe we’re really alone and there’s no one else in the entire
              universe. This should be highly unlikely, because of all the
              numbers we’ve seen before. So the best explanation for this is
              that we’re taking too much stuff for granted, and one of the steps
              between having a habitable planet and actually developing a
              galaxy-colonising civilisation must be nearly impossible to
              achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This hypothetical nearly impossible step is commonly referred as
              the Great Filter: there are probably many planets creating the
              simplest forms of life out there, but at some point in the
              evolution process there’s this filter that eliminates almost all
              of them. These are some of the steps that might qualify as the
              Great Filter:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Habitable star system</li>
              <li>Reproductive molecules</li>
              <li>Simple (prokaryotic) single-cell life</li>
              <li>Complex (archaeatic and eukaryotic) single-cell life</li>
              <li>Sexual reproduction</li>
              <li>Multi-cell life</li>
              <li>Tool-using animals with big brains</li>
              <li>Intelligent life</li>
              <li>Colonisation explosion</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In this list, we’re currently on step 8, which means that we’ve
              successfully transitioned from all the previous steps.
              Unfortunately, because we don’t about any species from other
              planets, we don’t know how easy any of these steps are. Did we
              already pass the Great Filter and we’re now on our way to colonise
              the galaxy? Or is the Great Filter ahead of us?
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many reasons to why the Great Filter could lie ahead of
              us: maybe a civilisation is unable to start harvesting its
              galaxy’s resources before running out of its own planet’s. Or
              maybe the development of advanced artificial intelligence can
              result in extinction due to unexpected consequences. Or getting to
              galaxy exploration may take too much time to avoid some
              life-ending asteroid collision. Among many other depressing
              possibilities.

            <h2 id="back-to-mars-what-can-we-learn">
              Back to Mars, what can we learn?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Looking back at the list of possible steps for the Great Filter,
              what would it mean for us to find life on Mars?
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine that we find life on Mars at step 5: “sexual
              reproduction”. This means that that step and all the previous ones
              were easy steps, since 2 out of 2 studied planets (Earth and Mars)
              managed to get there. So the probability that the nearly
              impossible step lies ahead suddenly increases. In addition, still
              considering that example, we can assume that the next step,
              “multi-cell life”, would also be easy, since we’ve got records of
              that happening
              <a
                href="http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/grosberg/Grosberg pdf papers/2007 Grosberg &amp; Strathmann.AREES.pdf"
                >46 times</a
              >
              already. So the only possible difficult steps would be 7
              (“tool-using animals with big brains”), 8 (“intelligent life”) or
              9 (“colonisation explosion”). That would mean that the probability
              of having the Great Filter ahead of us would suddenly jump to 1
              out of 3.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, in conclusion, if we found life on Mars, we’d probably be
              doomed, because that would mean that the chances of having the
              Great Filter ahead of us would increase dramatically. And having
              the Great Filter ahead of us means that our chances of reaching
              the next evolutionary step are as good as none.

                Even if I do want to broaden the scope to include this topic, it
                will likely be as a more evergreen piece of content that isn't
                directly related to a specific talk.</i
