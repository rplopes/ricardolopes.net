              This post was supposed to be yet another Windows 8 review but, as
              I’ve gained experience with the latest Microsoft OS, I saw the
              potential for something a little more interesting. I’ve been using
              Windows 8 as the only OS in my main computer since it was
              officially released by Microsoft, so I might say I have some
              experience, now, to tell you a thing or two about it that you
              probably missed in other reviews. I’ve already used Windows, Mac
              and Linux as my primary OS (and I tend to change it quite
              frequently), and I find advantages and disadvantages in all of
              them. I’m pretty “agnostic” in most technology debates, and OSs
              aren’t an exception, so these thoughts aren’t distorted by fanboy
              opinions. I didn’t do a simple review not only because the
              Internet is full of it (really, I’m not even posting any links),
              but because my continuous usage of this new OS kept bugging me
              more and more about very specific details. So I’ll skip the
              typical suspense and just tell you my quick opinion about it, so I
              can discuss what I see as the most pressing issue: what Windows 8
              could have been.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, I know many people don’t agree with me, but I actually
              think Microsoft changed the game with Windows 8 and the Surface.
              The notion of converging the laptop and tablet experience seems
              almost intuitive to me. As you might already know, tablets are the
              latest revolution in computing and are slowly throwing laptops to
              oblivion as once laptops did to desktop PCs (OK, I know it’s not
              that simple, but when we look at market shares there’s no doubt
              the landscape is changing). Tablets are also more portable than
              the thinnest ultrabooks, have a more intuitive and friendly input,
              don’t have the dreaded noisy fans, have better communication
              options and so on (I could go on listing the advantages of tablets
              over any laptop, but I guess I made my point already). So isn’t it
              silly that we’re still using them just as consumption devices
              (read: overpriced toys)? Is the great revolution in computing
              really only worth it for browsing Facebook and throwing some birds
              at evil pigs?
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer, of course, is no. If these devices are so much better
              than their ancestors, then we must be able to switch and leave the
              old laptops behind. Some power users might not be able to do it,
              but that’s exactly what happened in the transition from desktop
              PCs to laptops anyway. Apple has been very careful in this matter:
              they have slowly improved iOS to meet more demands and updated Mac
              OS to be more iOS-like. They’re basically doing baby steps for
              converging the two OSs, cautious not to make a very risky move.
              I’m still very curious about what the conclusion of that
              convergence might look like. Microsoft, on the other hand, went
              all-in about the matter and evolved from a pure PC OS to a
              completely hybrid, both tablet-friendly and “traditional”.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my opinion, and this might be controversial, Microsoft decided,
              for a change, to be the innovator and to push to the market a
              concept that is probably ahead of its time. They were so proud of
              their concept, they even build their own tablet/laptop hybrid just
              so they could show the full picture of their envisioned game
              changer product. This move is as refreshing as it is unexpected.
              So, as you can see by now, Windows 8 and the tablet/laptop hybrids
              approach have really caught my eye and promise to be a welcome
              revolution brought by an unexpected player.
            </p>
            <p>
              So… what could possibly go wrong? Here are some of the details
              I’ve been struggling with lately.
            </p>
            <h2 id="affordances">Affordances</h2>
            <p>
              In interaction design, affordance is the quality of an element to
              display to a user how it is supposed to be used. Imagine a door
              with no signs and with equal handles on both sides. That’s an
              example of poor affordance, since you don’t know if you’re
              supposed to push it or pull it. A door with better affordance
              would have the handle only in the side where you needed to pull
              and probably a sign in each side displaying the correct action.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Modern UI design aka Windows Store design aka Metro style
              design is, in my opinion, a nice UI that makes Windows Phone 7 and
              8 look much more fresh and lively than the big guys iOS and
              Android. However, I’m not so sure about it in tablets and
              specially on regular PCs. One of its major advantages, the flat UI
              that strips down the unnecessary and focuses on content, is also
              one of its major flaws, because you’re also losing some important
              elements that weren’t just there for decoration. Don’t agree?
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="./2015-01-23-w8-settings.png"
                alt="Windows 8 affordances example"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              This image is showing two different elements from the same screen
              (not in their actual position, just next to each other in this
              picture for comparison). The one on the top is just a title with
              no action on click, and the one in the bottom is a button to a
              settings page (although we’re already in a settings panel, and
              another button in the same panel already points us to the Control
              Panel, another settings tool).
            </p>
            <p>
              I could add more examples, but I hope you got the idea. Cleaning
              the UI is a very good idea, but you must do it with caution. “Make
              it as simple as possible, but not simpler”.
            </p>
            <h2 id="the-best-of-two-worlds">The best of two worlds?</h2>
            <p>
              One of Windows 8′s most ambitious promises is the convergence of
              desktop and tablet experiences. As I said, I’m a big fan of that
              concept and I believe that’s a trend to follow. But a concept is
              one thing, execution is another. My ideal use case would be
              something like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I pick my tablet for working on the go. Since I don’t have
                paperwork nor a cumbersome laptop to carry, travelling with
                everything I need for work (just a tablet) is easier than ever.
                In those free times I can just turn on my tablet and browse my
                favourite websites, check my email and so on. When I get to my
                office I just link the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and the HDMI
                display, start the traditional environment and fire up the MS
                Office suite, the IDE, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next day I decide to do some work at a coffee shop, so I just
                bring the tablet and a keyboard (a Surface keyboard would add no
                bulk to the pack, and a keyboard dock like what we see in Asus’s
                offerings would, in a worst case scenario, make me feel like I’m
                carrying a thin netbook).
              </p>
              <p>
                When going to meetings, presentations or others I simply carry
                the tablet and use it with the onscreen keyboard, since I won’t
                be typing long sequences of text. In between, I think about my
                laptop and wonder when was the last time I used that heavy,
                noisy and awkward machine.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This use case is what I think when I see new hybrids in the market
              running full-blown OSs in a tablet form and when I hear Microsoft
              state how Windows 8 promises to deliver the best of both worlds.
              Unfortunately, that’s not what’s happening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, Windows RT, a dumbed-down version of Windows 8 developed
              to run on ARM processors, miserably fails to live up to that
              promise, as you won’t be able to run legacy apps in it (read: you
              can’t install typical desktop applications, like the ones you
              absolutely must have for your job).
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, when using a tablet with no mouse or keyboard, this ideal
              vision means not interacting with the traditional desktop and its
              windows, as they’re not the most touch friendly interfaces you’ll
              see. So it’s too bad that actions such as file management and
              configuring some settings have to be done in the desktop
              environment. I can’t help but think that Microsoft’s tight
              schedule for Windows 8 left many holes in the OS, and this lack of
              support for the continuous use of the tablet environment shows
              many of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              These holes in the OS aren’t an exclusive of the tablet interface.
              As an example, in the desktop mode hitting the Networks taskbar
              icon brings a panel in line with the new design, but hitting the
              Sound or Power taskbar icons still brings the old style popup.
              Also, when using the desktop environment, the Charms bar has close
              to no functionality (but it still shows up when hitting
              non-configurable hot corners). There are many more rough corners
              that still need to be polished if this is to look like a finished
              product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the integration of these two poorly-implemented worlds is
              nothing but disappointment. If you like a Metro application, you
              can’t run it as a window in the desktop environment (nor can you
              go full-screen in most desktop applications). If you open a file
              in one of the environments, the only way to move it to the other
              environment is to open it again manually using another
              application. The only way to see two Metro apps at once (or any
              Metro app while using the desktop interface) is by snapping one of
              them to the left or right of the screen. However, you have no
              control of the size of each app, and you can’t have two documents
              side by side, since the distributed space isn’t 50%-50%, but more
              like 75%-25%.
            </p>
            <h2 id="apps-apps-apps">Apps, apps, apps</h2>
            <p>
              At the end of the day, what really matters is the applications.
              That’s why most users prefer Mac OS or Linux over Windows, but
              when you look at market shares that’s not what it looks like.
              However, with this new OS Microsoft seems to be trying to get rid
              of its huge market advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I’ve stated before, there’s not much integration between the
              two different environments of Windows 8. So, while you have a huge
              collection of legacy apps in the traditional one, you’ll feel the
              emptiness of options in the newest one. If desktop apps could
              integrate with the tablet mode this wouldn’t be such a big issue,
              because we’d have something to cover that emptiness while the new
              apps ecosystem was being developed. But we don’t, so if you’re
              like me you’ll probably want to make use of that awesome new
              environment, but will find no reason for it and eventually give
              up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things get pretty ugly if you consider Windows RT instead of 8,
              because it also has a desktop mode but lacks the support for
              legacy apps. So yes, the market leader that has built its success
              on top of its huge apps ecosystem has just started a new one from
              scratch and one of the versions of its newest OS doesn’t even
              support the old one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, if this new desktop/tablet mix in the same OS serves as a
              “bridge” from the old ecosystem to the new, I can’t figure a
              simple reason for Microsoft to launch the Surface with RT before
              launching the Surface with 8. They basically launched a device
              with virtually no ecosystem and waited to later launch a similar
              device with support for all Windows applications. That’s like
              trying to build a whole village in a desert island and only later
              building a bridge to it. I wonder how much has Microsoft lost with
              this new, unpopulated village already.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, if we look to the Metro apps that come with the OS,
              there’s also some aspects that make me think this could have gone
              a totally different way. The built-in calendar app couldn’t import
              all calendars from my Google account (in fact, it could only
              import the personal one), so it’s useless for me. The messaging
              app can’t send new messages if I’m set as invisible, and can’t get
              them from contacts that show up as offline, so this one’s also
              useless for me. Thanks to the poor integration between the two
              environments, I can’t get a mini player of the XBox Music app
              (only a snapped panel from top to bottom that shrinks my
              horizontal desktop area). These are just some examples of the poor
              job that leave us early adopters with little incentive to keep
              trying the new environment.
            </p>
            <h2 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h2>
            <p>
              Please don’t get me wrong: I love Windows 8′s concept and I share
              (more or less) Microsoft’s vision for the future of computers. If
              this was the typical review, I’d spend more time highlighting some
              good implementations and how I believe it’s the right direction. I
              might even have recommended the upgrade. However, my goal is to
              highlight what I find poorly implemented in such a great concept.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to this whole notebook/tablet hybrid concept, I’ve started
              to look at the latest ultrabooks as kind of obsolete devices. They
              don’t have touch screens, it’s impossible to use them while
              walking without looking awkward, and so forth. The same goes for
              all Apple’s notebook options (that’s probably the reason why most
              Apple fans don’t agree with this vision). However, after quite
              some time with Windows 8, I fear we don’t have a strong
              alternative yet. Yes, this is definitely an important step in that
              direction, but it’s still looking too immature, for now. Windows 8
              seems to have suffered a lot from its tight schedule and, thanks
              to this incomplete effort, we now have a vision of what’s to come,
              but are left with a poor demo of it.

              All in all, this could have been a new revolution in the way we
              use our computers. As it stands, it’s nothing but a glimpse of
              what that revolution might look like. Maybe they’ll get it right
              in an hypothetical Windows 9. After all, Microsoft is known for
              releasing great versions of Windows after disappointing ones, and
              disappointing versions after great ones (and so far, this pattern
              seems unchanged). Or maybe Apple will get it right first.

                to link preservation. Anyway, glad to see that the newer Windows
                versions (10 and 11 at this time) don't look so unpolished.</i
