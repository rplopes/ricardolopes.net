          <h2>Information to Recruiters</h2>
          <p>
            I get a high volume of inboud messages about new job opportunities.
            I don't switch jobs without a good reason, and don't have enough
            free time to engage with multiple hiring processes. In addition,
            many contacts are either not relevant for me (wrong tech stack,
            wrong experience level...), or simply don't provide enough useful
            information to decide if it's a worthy opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            To filter signal from noise, I've established inbound messages rules
            that I require anyone sending me job opportunities to follow.
            <strong
              >If you're sending me a job opportunity without complying with
              those rules, that tells me you're spamming me without having done
              your homework, so your message will be ignored</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are the rules for inbound messages about job oportunities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Salary range <strong>required</strong>: it's a waste of time for
              both parties to go through the process just to find later that
              it's a salary downgrade
            </li>
            <li>
              Senior or leadership positions only: if someone is presenting me a
              mid-level job, it tells me they haven't even skimmed my CV before
              contacting me
            </li>
            <li>
              Remote only, ideally with flexible schedule, and no relocation:
              This is how I can deliver my best work
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can find an updated version of my CV and contact me on
            <a
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardopintolopes"
              >LinkedIn</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will try to reply to every contact that follows these rules, even
            if just to say that I'm not looking for job changes at that moment.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for your understanding!</p>
